## Introduction
This project aims at introducing graph neural networks and [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/ "Deep Graph Library") to communication systems.  **The content continues updating.**

## Specific Information
1. Folder **Supervised** implemented the MLP and GNN for K-user interference channel power control, trained with supervised learning.

2. Folder **D2D, Cell-free, and Hybrid** is the Pytorch implementation for reproducing the results in

- Folder **D2D** implemented MLP, Edge convolution, and proposed GNN for D2D power control.
- Folder **Cell-free** implemented MLP, Heterogenous GNN, and proposed GNN for power control in cell-free massive MIMO.
- Folder **Hybrid** implemented MLP and proposed unrolling method for hybrid precoding.
